						Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[7] The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
					</p>
			
					<p>
						Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,[9] cough, headache,[10] fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[11][12][13] Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.[14] Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[15] Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[16] Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids, in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms.
					</p>

					<p>
						Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						Preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmissions.

						Alpha variant, also known as lineage B.1.1.7,[a] is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. One of several variants of concern, it is estimated to be 40%–80% (with most estimates occupying the middle to higher end of this range)[b] more transmissible than the wild-type SARS-CoV-2. It was first detected in November 2020 from a sample taken in September in the United Kingdom. It began to spread quickly by mid-December, around the same time as infections surged. This increase is thought to be at least partly because of one or more mutations in the virus's spike protein. The variant is also notable for having more mutations than normally seen.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						As of January 2021, more than half of all genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was carried out in the UK.[3] This has given rise to questions as to how many other important variants may be circulating around the world undetected.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						On 2 February 2021, Public Health England reported that they had detected "[a] limited number of B.1.1.7 VOC-202012/01 genomes with E484K mutations",[6] which they dubbed Variant of Concern 202102/02 (VOC-202102/02).[7] One of the mutations (N501Y) is also present in Beta variant and Gamma variant.

						Beta variant,[1][2] also known as lineage B.1.351,[a] is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. One of several SARS-CoV-2 variants believed to be of particular importance, it was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay[5] metropolitan area of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa in October 2020,[6] which was reported by the country's health department on 18 December 2020.[7] Phylogeographic analysis suggests this variant emerged in the Nelson Mandela Bay already in July or August 2020.

					<p>
						Gamma caused widespread infection in early 2021 in the city of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, although the city had already experienced widespread infection in May 2020,[10] with a study[11] indicating high seroprevalence of antibodies for SARS-CoV-2.[12] A research article published in Science Journal indicate that P.1 diseased people has greater chance of transmissibility and death than B.1.1.28 infected.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						Variant Gamma comprises the two distinct subvariants 28-AM-1 and 28-AM-2, which both carry the K417T, E484K, N501Y mutations, and which both developed independently of each other within the same Brazilian Amazonas region.
					</p>

					<p>
						Gamma is notably different from the Zeta variant (lineage P.2) which is also circulating strongly in Brazil. In particular, Zeta only carries the E484K mutation and has neither of the other two mutations of concern, N501Y and K417T

				<p>
					SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as lineage B.1.617.2, is a variant of lineage B.1.617 of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.[1] It was first detected in India in late 2020.[2][3] The World Health Organization (WHO) named it the Delta variant on 31 May 2021.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					It has mutations in the gene encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein[5] causing the substitutions T478K, P681R and L452R,[6] which are known to affect transmissibility of the virus as well as whether it can be neutralised by antibodies for previously circulating variants of the COVID-19 virus.[7][failed verification] In May 2021, Public Health England (PHE) observed secondary attack rates to be 51–67% higher than the alpha variant.[8] COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing severe disease or hospitalisation from infection with the variant; some evidence suggests vaccinated people are more likely to develop symptoms from Delta than other variants of SARS-CoV-2
				</p>
		
				<p>
					On 7 May 2021, PHE changed their classification of lineage B.1.617.2 from a variant under investigation (VUI) to a variant of concern (VOC) based on an assessment of transmissibility being at least equivalent to B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant);[10] the UK's SAGE subsequently estimated a "realistic" possibility of being 50% more transmissible.[11] On 11 May 2021, the WHO also classified this lineage VOC, and said that it showed evidence of higher transmissibility and reduced neutralisation. On 15 June 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared Delta a variant of concern
				</p>
		
				<p>
					The variant is thought to be partly responsible for India's second wave of the pandemic beginning in February 2021.[13][14][15] It later contributed to a third wave in Fiji, the United Kingdom[16][17] and South Africa,[18] and the WHO warned in July 2021 it could have a similar effect elsewhere in Europe and Africa.[19][18] By late July it had also driven an increase in daily infections in parts of Asia,[20] the United States,[21] and Australia.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					As of 20 July 2021, the variant had spread to 124 countries,[23] and WHO indicated that if it were not already the dominant 		strain that it was becoming the dominant strain globally
