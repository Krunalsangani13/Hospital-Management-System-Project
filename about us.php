				<p>
					Wockhardt Hospital’s existence is the result of a 50-year tradition of caring and 
					innovation nurtured by Wockhardt Ltd,
					India’s 5th largest Pharmaceutical and Healthcare company with a presence in 20 countries across the globe.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Within a short period since its inception, Wockhardt Hospitals has become a leading health service provider with 
					its strong presence in the western parts of the country i.e. Mumbai, Nagpur, Rajkot, Nasik and Surat. This group of 9 hospitals fulfills the need of the community in its chosen field of super specialty like Cardiology, Orthopedics, Neurology, Gastroenterology, Urology, Aesthetics and Minimal Access Surgery.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					We follow process driven quality systems that adhere to international standards of clinical care, safe environment, infection control and respect for patient rights & privacy. With state of the art multi-disciplinary capabilities and world-class infrastructure and technology, we enrich the quality of life of every patient in a caring and nurturing environment
				</p> 


				<p>
					Many of the Wockhardt group of hospitals has accreditation of the NABH (National Accreditation Board of Hospitals & Healthcare), the highest and the most stringent quality standards institution in India and the National authority in healthcare accreditation. To meet these standards the hospital needs to have a quality driven approach right from the patient registration, admission, pre-surgery & post-surgery protocols, discharge from the hospitals to follow ups after discharge.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					In pursuance of its vision to establish state-of-the-art medical facilities in India along with a high degree of clinical excellence, we have entered into strategic alliances with Partners Medical International, USA, whereby Wockhardt has access to Harvard’s expertise and experience in the fields of surgery and other Medicare services.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Partners Medical International (a non- profit organization) serves as a catalyst in bringing together healthcare professionals from around the globe towards improving the delivery of healthcare through education and implementing its vision that every citizen of the world should have access to quality healthcare in their own country. Today, Harvard Medical International has selective collaborations with medical communities, Wockhardt hospitals being one of them.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Wockhardt group of hospitals in India is a preferred destination for patients from Europe, USA, Africa, Middle East and South Asia. Most of the doctors/surgeons have been trained or worked extensively at some of the best medical institutions in US, Europe and other advanced countries.
